This Java program is designed to handle user login attempts and validate passwords. The program defines custom exceptions (MaxLogInException & InvalidPasswordException) to handle specific error conditions and provides functionality to repeatedly prompt the user for a password until a valid one is entered or the maximum number of attempts (3) is reached.
